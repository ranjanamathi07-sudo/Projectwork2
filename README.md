## Predictive Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning Models
The project focuses on detecting ransomware attacks at an early stage by analyzing system and network behavior using machine learning techniques, thereby improving cybersecurity and minimizing potential damage.

## About
Predictive Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning Models is designed to identify malicious ransomware activity before it fully executes and encrypts system data. Traditional antivirus solutions rely heavily on signature-based detection, which often fails against new or evolving ransomware variants.

This project overcomes these limitations by leveraging behavioral features such as file operations, cryptographic activity, entropy changes, and network behavior. Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated to classify system activity as benign or malicious, ensuring accurate and reliable ransomware detection.

## Features

- Behavioral-based ransomware detection approach
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- High detection accuracy with model consensus
- Early-stage prediction to prevent file encryption
- Scalable and modular architecture
- Low false-positive rate

## Requirements
* Operating System: Windows 10 / Ubuntu (64-bit)
* Programming Language: Python 3.7 or later
* Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
* Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
* Dataset: Ransomware and benign system behavior dataset
* Version Control: Git for source code management

## System Architecture
This architecture illustrates a machine learning–based ransomware detection pipeline that analyzes file activity, process behavior, and network traffic to identify malicious actions.
By using models like Random Forest, Neural Networks, and SVM, the system classifies activities as normal or suspicious and enables timely data protection and system security.
